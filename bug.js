This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is a common error in React Native, particularly when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or navigating between screens.  The error message might not always pinpoint the exact location, making debugging more challenging.  For example, accessing `user.name` when `user` is null will throw this error.  It's often associated with components that haven't received their props or state updates yet.
