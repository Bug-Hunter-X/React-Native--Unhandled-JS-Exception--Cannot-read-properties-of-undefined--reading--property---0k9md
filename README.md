This repository demonstrates a common React Native error: attempting to access a property of a null or undefined object.  The `bug.js` file showcases the error, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using optional chaining and nullish coalescing.  This pattern is crucial for robust error handling in React Native applications.  The error often arises from asynchronous data fetching, where components try to access data before it's available.  The solution uses modern JavaScript features to handle these scenarios gracefully.
